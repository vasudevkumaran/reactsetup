There is a temporary fix for now (if you're using Windows)!

1st Close Android Studio

2nd Open CMD and write:  taskkill /f /im adb.exe

3rd Download this file: http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r28.0.2-windows.zip

4th Go to

C:\Users[your-username]\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk

and replace the "platform-tools" folder with the new one that you just downloaded.

ps: (a) don't forget to keep the backup (b) the AppData is a hidden folder
